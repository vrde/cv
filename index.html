                        I worked with two other engineers on a cutting edge technology for <strong>street lighting.</strong>
                        The smart street lights we built were equipped with a microcontroller and were able to
                        communicate with a central router. My role was to write the <strong>Python</strong> code
                        to run in the router.
                        The router was programmed to: turn on/off the lights, dim the light intensity, collect
                        information about the condition of the lights installed, compress and send the collected data to a
                        remote server, and display on a screen the state of the lights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system was integrated also with the legacy controller provided by the client, and it was
                        able to react to emergency situations.
                        The system was able to communicate via RS485 and XBee, using the MODBUS protocol.

                            Technically speaking, it wasn't a challenge, but it was an <strong>interesting experience</strong>
                            to work for a women's refuge. I set up for them a custom Wordpress installation,
                            and I taught them how to use the CMS. At the same time, I learned a bit more about
                            how they work to give psychological support to women who have been abused.
